== Question
Is it really asciidoc format?

Looks like it really is.

See, for example, a list:

* one
* two
* not two

Or, let's try a table

.Sample Table Title
|===
|Event |ela

|SQL*Net Message to Client
|123456

|db file sequential read
|123

|===

Another table

[format="csv", options="header"]
|===
event,p1,p2,p3,ela
direct path read,1,2,3, 4095
db file scattered read,4,5,55, 404
|===
